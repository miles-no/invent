# Profiling

A proof-of-concept project to show how to use profiler for performance analysis.

## Run

To test the profiler, you need a profiler tool. The easiest option is to use a profiler built in your IDE.
Open the project in your IDE and run the `src/long_main.cpp` file with profiling enabled. 

If you are using the [CLion IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), there is a "Profile" button next to Run and Debug buttons.
