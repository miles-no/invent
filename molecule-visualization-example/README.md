# Molecule Visualization Example

This is a simple example of how to load a PDB file and visualize it in a browser,
using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

The source is mostly based on the [PDB loader example](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=pdb#webgl_loader_pdb).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open the browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Production build

To build the project for production, run `npm run build`. The built files will be in the `build` directory.

You can preview the production version by running `npm run preview`.
