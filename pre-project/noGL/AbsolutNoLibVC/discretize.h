///     parseLatFitPDB myLatticeProt();
///     myLatticeProt.parseLatFitPDB(discretizedPDB);       //can omit second argument
///
/// - convert latfit PDB files into lattice coordinates and description with multi-chain SLURD
///     myLatticeProt.transform() // note: it only works if the positions are following 90 degrees angles (latfit output).
///
/// - extract the lattice protein as a 'superProtein' class
///     superProtein* inLatticeProtein = myLatticeProt.asSuperProtein()
///
/// (optional: in order to add glycans to the lattice protein:)
/// - read the original PDB file and extract the glycan positions on selected chains
///     readGlycans glycansPos("OriginalPDB.pdb", "AB")

/// All these steps are normally handled by the PDB class, that can read a PDB, call latfit, and calls the functions
